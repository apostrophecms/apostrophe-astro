# Changelog

## UNRELEASED

* Visiting the `/login` page when already logged in no longer results in
an undesired direct response from Apostrophe. Redirects within the site issued
on the Apostrophe side are now passed back through Astro, allowing Astro to decide
whether to proxy them or handle them directly according to its normal rules.
* Use `node-fetch` rather than `undici` for its multivalued headers support.

## 1.0.6 (2024-03-26)

* Change the way we fetch from Apostrophe by using `undici` `request` method, so as all headers are correctly forwarded. As on latest Node.js versions, headers like `Host` are no more forwarded by the regular `fetch` global method.

## 1.0.5 (2024-02-07)

* Compatible with Astro's `ViewTransition` feature when editing, via
a workaround. Since this workaround imposes a performance penalty
(only for editors, not the public), the `viewTransitionWorkaround`
option must be set to `true` to enable it.

## 1.0.4 (2024-01-22)

* Documentation fixes only.

## 1.0.3 (2023-12-27)

* Documentation typo that impacts Linux and other case sensitive systems fixed.

## 1.0.2 (2023-12-22)

* Fix bug causing pages to crash after refresh if widget
grouping is used.

## 1.0.1 (2023-12-21)

* Fix bug impacting two-column widgets.

## 1.0.0 (2023-12-21)

* Initial release.
